# (1) We list our current definition
# (2) Modify it to have a keyboard mapping using the name
#     we used above, in this case it's the "remote" definition
#     described in the file named "custom" which we specify in
#     this world as "custom(remote)".
# (3) Now we take that as input back into our definition of the
#     keyboard. This includes the file we just made, read in last,
#     so as to override any prior definitions.  Importantly we 
#     need to include the directory of the place we placed the file
#     to be considered when reading things in.
#
# Also notice that we aren't including exactly the 
# directory we specified above. In this case, it will be looking
# for a directory structure similar to /usr/share/X11/xkb
# 
# What we provided was a "symbols" file. That's why above we put
# the file into a "symbols" directory, which is not being included
# below.
